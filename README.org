** Arduino considerations

The state machine is written in C++17. To allow for this to work with
Arduino, the =platform.txt= needs to change so that it enables C++17.

On my system, this is the file

 =~/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/mbed_rp2040/4.0.2/=

The following line must be present:

#+begin_src python
compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-std=gnu++17
#+end_src
